The game is written in HTML5 and JavaScript. It consists of a box that the player controls and must navigate through obstacles in the air. It uses a canvas element to draw the game area and the components of the game, such as the box and the obstacles. The game also keeps track of the player's score. The game logic is implemented using JavaScript, including the movement of the box and collision detection between the box and the obstacles.It runs on a loop that updates the game area and re-renders the canvas with the updated positions of the game elements.
